This project is **work-in-progress**!

When finished it can be used to generate all needed splashscreen and icon files for Cordova projects based on single source files.

Android supports [NinePatch drawables](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/drawables#nine-patch) for its splashscreens - this project automatically generates them when a `*.9.png` filename is chosen for the generated splashscreen file.


## ToDo

- add icon defaults
- improve readme
- add `./bin/`
- add tests
- ..
